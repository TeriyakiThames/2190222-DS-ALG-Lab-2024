## Eclipse
- It is recommended to use `Eclipse` since you can easily install `JUnit` for grader to test your code as well as to export your `.jar` file. The exam will also use `Eclipse` so might as well get used to it now ðŸ¤“.
- Using `Eclipse` also allows you to automatically create `getter` and `setter` methods without having to write them out. (`source/Generate Getters and Setters ...`)
- It also allows you to generate a constructor as well, but don't forget to remove `super();` if not inheriting. (`source/Generate Constructors Using Fields ...`)
